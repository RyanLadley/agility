<!--Feel Free to change/add/remove class names on anything here and rearange the div's to any way you would like. 
Dont change the "ng-model", "ng-click", and "name" porameters though, they are for tha javascript.
Also, don't move inputs and buttons outside of the <form> that are in. Everything else is fair game
The {{failureMessage.*}} will only be visible if there is is an error in registering or login.
Shoot me a text or call if you have a question

This might be a bit confusing, feel free to ask me anything. Remember, dumb questions are encouraged

Oh and you might download a text editor called 'Sublime'. It has syntax highlighting which makes life a bit easier-->
